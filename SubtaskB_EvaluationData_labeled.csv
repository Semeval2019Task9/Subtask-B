0,"This hotel was very modern and sleek.",0
1,"Beautiful, well-laid out, albeiit small rooms.",0
2,"Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker,",0
3,"the staff were uber-helpful.",0
4,"Great location in front of a u-bahn stop.",0
5,"Our first trip to Berlin, so we were unfamiliar with the city layout.",0
6,"But we were drawn to the design of the Art'otel.",0
7,"Yes, the public spaces are nicely designed,",0
8,"as are the rooms.",0
9,"But the rooms are small and not very functional.",0
10,"And the location is definitely out of the way (although there is an U-bahn station just a half block away).",0
11,"And we were really put off by the tourist buses and groups.",0
12,"Not really our scene.",0
13,"If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel.",1
14,"The ones on the front are very noisy.",0
15,"Directly across the street from an informal bus terminus the hotel is also very convenient for the U-Bahn into town and some points in the East on foot, but quite a walk away from the heart of things.",0
16,"The staff was friendly and tried to be accomodating, but couldn't give me a non-smoking room for the first night, nor an internal room,",0
17,"and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived.",1
18,"Too much attention on 'fabulousness' throughout the hotel (the public spaces are sleek and unwelcoming) and not enough on basic guest comfort.",0
19,"Having previously enjoyed a great week's stay at the sister art'otel in Berlin (the Warhol-themed City Centre West), we decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel so we could visit more of the sights on the eastern side of the city.",0
20,"The difference was stark.",0
21,"This hotel is located in a very quiet district - barely a passing car on a weekday, completely dead at the weekendand with no local facilities.",0
22,"The one bar round the corner had one old pensioner propping the bar up on a Friday evening.",0
23,"The hotel itself is already showing signs of age.",0
24,"The fixtures and fittings in the room were tired and worn; edges of shelves worn away, carpets badly stained, window blinds torn and damaged.",0
25,"The room was very much smaller than in the sister hotel,",0
26,"though the bed was amply sized as in all German hotels.",0
27,"Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide.",0
28,"The room was effectively air conditioned (i.e. you could control temperature and speed yourself)",0
29,"and this is essential as the hotel's proximity to a very still tributary to the Spree means that the area is plagued by large, voracious mosquitoes.",0
30,"Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify!",0
31,"During my stay I needed to use the internet in order to check-in for our return flight.",0
32,"The cost of using the solitary PC in the lobby was extortionate.",0
33,"Given the low cost of internet access and PC hardware, all decent hotels now offer such 'business centre' services for free - here,",0
34,"it was a credit card driven system charging 1Euro for 3 minutes online time and extra for every printed page.",0
35,"As a general tip, if you need to use the internet whilst in Berlin, look up the Easy Internet cafes before you go, there's a huge one in Kurfurstendam",1
36,"and at least one more I saw elsewhere - there access costs 1 Euro for an hour!",0
37,"Overall, the stay at Berlin Mitte was not what I expected from a hotel chain which calls its most basic room 'Superior'.",0
38,"It needs to decide whether it wants to be 'designer' or just a smart hostel.",0
39,"For UK travellers, the room was the same size",0
40,"and in the same condition as you'd find in a Travelodge.",0
41,"If you expect no more than that, you won't be disappointed.",1
42,"Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to step out of their hotel and straight into the action,",0
43,"this won't ring your bell as all destinations will require at least a half hour walk or public transport journey.",0
44,"Rooms nices, Staff helpful.",0
45,"Beds firm, pillows very soft.",0
46,"No shampoo provided in the room, Shower Gel dispensers don't work well.",0
47,"Breakfast expensive, supermarket not far, Good value Internet cafe nearby.",0
48,"Close to museum island and U-ban just outside hotel.",0
49,"Our perfect hotel is one that offers a central location to the attractions we want to see - with spacious, comfortable rooms and good service.",0
50,"art'otel, Mitte in Berlin definitely fulfilled these requirements.",0
51,"Our room (superior double) was very spacious and extremely comfortable - with a bath for relaxing those tired walking muscles.",0
52,"The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.",0
53,"The Hotel is less than 1/2 block from the closest U Bhan station - but is situated in a quiet street.",0
54,"Walking time to many sights (Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmakt, Deutches Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Nikolaivertel etc. was less than 15 minutes - while virtually everything else was easily accessible by U-Bahn, starting almost next door.",0
55,"Spent 3 nights recently at the Artotel Berlin Mitte.",0
56,"It was supposed to be a designer hotel,",0
57,"I have searched for the design,",0
58,"but I haven't found any kind of design in the rooms.",0
59,"May be the restaurant have something,",0
60,"but the rooms are poorly decorated, with common furniture.",0
61,"The bed was not very comfortable.",0
62,"In the bathroom there is only liquid soap with two small towels.",0
63,"Do not expect any kind of luxury at Artotel Berlin Mitte,",0
64,"it is only a basic hotel, but with a convenient location (50 meters from the metro, 2 metro stations from Alexander platz).",0
65,"The breakfast was good and the staff friendly.",0
66,"We stayed at The Regent in August for two days to celebrate my birthday.",0
67,"Location.... perfect; staff.... warm, welcoming and professional; room... perfectly appointed; food... sublime.",0
68,"Certainly one of... if not THE best hotels ever!",0
69,"The hotel is ideally located.",0
70,"If you're a walker, you are close to many attractions.",0
71,"Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower.",1
72,"No curtains, and water pours off you onto the tile floor which has a drain.",0
73,"Put your towel on the wet floor or you will definitely slip.",0
74,"Desk staff needs to go to a Waldorf class on manners.",1
75,"Very cold reception, couldn't answer a few simple questions for directions to a few of the sights or an ATM.",0
76,"Room was nice but does need to be vacuumed more frequently than ours was..",0
77,"Pretzels and cookies under the bed.",0
78,"Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.",1
79,"We turned the cushions over.",0
80,"What a difference..",0
81,"Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly.",1
82,"Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..",1
83,"Liked the room, and the location, but didn't care for the staff of the hotel.",0
84,"Look around the same area for another hotel.",1
85,"Think you can do better.",0
86,"We stayed in the Westin Grand Berlin in July 2007.",0
87,"In spite of the fact that the reservation we made through the Starwood Hotels website said our rooms would have Westin's renowned Heavenly Beds, we found that only a few suites actually have the beds.",0
88,"The beds we were subjected to were firm to the point of being like sleeping on a sidewalk.",0
89,"Had we not been told in advance how wonderful our stay would be because of the Heavenly Beds,",0
90,"we might not have been as unpleasantly surprised.",0
91,"The beds and fitness center made it definitely not like a usual Westin stay.",0
92,"The pool was lovely",0
93,"but the work-out room was small, dimly-lit, and hot.",0
94,"There were only two treadmills (one of which was broken), a Lifecycle bike, and four computerized weight machines.",0
95,"There was also one ratty, old floor mat.",0
96,"Almost everything in Germany had English translations, but not the machines there.",0
97,"With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins.",1
98,"There's a fantastic deli across the street where we purchased breakfast for four for half the price of a single continental breakfast at the hotel.",0
99,"The hotel had two positives: the concierge service and the location.",0
100,"The room price was actually pretty reasonable.",0
101,"This is an upscale business hotel, not a luxury hotel.",0
102,"The location is great,",0
103,"breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous",0
104,"but it lacks character and charm.",0
105,"There was no luggage rack",0
106,"although a call to housekeeping solved this problem.",0
107,"There was only 1 chair",0
108,"and the room was small.",0
109,"This was the last place we stayed after 2 weeks in Germany",0
110,"and it was disappointing to end our trip in a place that was so sterile and impersonal.",0
111,"The Hotel staff were attentive,",0
112,"and I enjoyed the location (near Brandenburg, Museum Island, etc), but I wasn't blown away.",0
113,"I stayed in one of the renovated rooms,",0
114,"and the room itself was quite comfortable--but very small.",0
115,"My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB).",0
116,"If you want a quiet Hotel near tourist sites, this is for you.",0
117,"If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.",1
118,"We stayed at The Westin Grand Hotel",0
119,"and it was just fine.",0
120,"We had a great time in Berlin",0
121,"and the hotel served its purpose.",0
122,"However, it was not spectacular for a few reasons.",0
123,"1. At first we got an unrenovated room.",0
124,"This was not too miserable",0
125,"but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed.",0
126,"I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed",0
127,"and boy were we wrong!",0
128,"The funny thing is,",0
129,"my husband is usually the one with the back pain!",0
130,"When we changed to a renovated room were were delighted with the bathroom",0
131,"but still stumped at exactly what was so heavenly about the bed.",0
132,"It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable.",0
133,"(We were making jokes about it being left over from the Communist era.",0
134,"Tee hee hee)2. Terrible smell of sewers down the corridors of hotel although, thankfully not in our room.",0
135,"3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.",0
136,"He seemed harried and annoyed at me asking too many questions.",0
137,"He recommended the restaurant Stamhouse which is part of the hotel.",0
138,"It was a sportsbar type place",0
139,"and the food was really not good.",0
140,"The main staff of the hotel were all very nice",0
141,"and they had a bunch of baby supplies for us that were helpful.",0
142,"Not a bad choice, but I wonder if we could have done a bit better...",0
143,"The location is absolutely ideal for a tourist trip to Berlin.",0
144,"So much is within walking distance,",0
145,"and that which is not is easily reached by transit.",0
146,"There are restaurants nearby, and plently of shopping.",0
147,"The hotel is a great building.",0
148,"We too, noticed the sound of the piano player in the evening, but this isn't the worst sound to have wafting into your room!",0
149,"Although I would think they could stop it a little earlier in the evening.",0
150,"Our room was very nicly furnished and clean with a large bathroom.",0
151,"Our rate inclued and extensive buffet breakfast - VERY nice, with an omlette bar and wide variety of hot and cold foods.",0
152,"I beleive they charge 24Euros for it if it is not included.",0
153,"I wouldn't pay that, but try to get a rate that includes breakfast!",0
154,"Stayed at the hotel over Easter 2005.",0
155,"This hotel is in two parts the new and the old.",0
156,"The new is 4 star",0
157,"and the old is 2 star.",0
158,"When we arrived we were impressed by the lobby and the friendly staff.",0
159,"When we were shown to our room we were given a twin bedded room in the old part of the hotel.",0
160,"We had booked a double bed.",0
161,"We were moved to a slightly better double room (two beds purshed together) but still in the old part of the hotel.",0
162,"The rooms in the old part are described as Classic.",0
163,"Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site.",1
164,"The rooms are shabby,",0
165,"the air conditioing did not work (left the balcony door wide open all night in March!), soft furnishings grubby, smelt unpleasant, the toilet broke (still not offered a change of room).",0
166,"The only positive things to say about the hotel is that it is in a very good location,",0
167,"the breakfast is excellent, friendly staff and lovely lobby with pianist.",0
168,"Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.",1
169,"I do not know what the quality of the rooms are like in the new part of the hotel.",0
170,"I would certainly never stay in this hotel again.",0
171,"Bit of a dissappointment to be honest.",0
172,"Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean!",1
173,"The wing where our rooms were had bad smell.",0
174,"When we complained about the smell the staff simply told us to open the windows.",0
175,"Some staff were very nice and helpful",0
176,"and others were not at all.",0
177,"When we mentioned our room hadn't been cleaned one day they simply dumped clean towels in the room and didn't even tidy up!",0
178,"There was also some inconsistency on the service...",0
179,"we were there with family",0
180,"and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate",0
181,"while the other room never got that...",0
182,"and we all checked in together and paid the same price!",0
183,"Had been warned of a noiseless facelift but was unprepared to battle my way through a foyer of painters",0
184,"and then have to step over debris and rolled up carpets to find the room.",0
185,"Really not worth the money for such a top class hotel.",0
186,"They should have closed for such extensive work",0
187,"and I think it is just greedy to keep it open but treat it's guests as second class citizens.",0
188,"My request to speak to the Manager was ignored as was a letter whilst I was staying there.",0
189,"Would not return as so much choice in Berlin but can say it's situation is ideal for walking to the sights.",0
213,"Forget about the rooms in this hotel!",0
218,"If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.",1
238,"If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.",1
240,"If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel.",0
247,"Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site.",1
260,"My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced.",1
261,"Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.",1
284,"and at ____13 overpriced as was the bottle of water strategically placed in the room at ____4.50. All in all I have no real complaints about the hotel and would have no problems in recommending it.",0
285,"If you are lucky enough to be awarded the hotel through priceline it really is a fantastic bargain.",0
316,"so I really highly recommend.",1
319,"but never before have I been offered a dirty, smelly room and then upcharged for a renovated(i.e. clean) room.",0
320,"So keep this in mind if you choose to stay here: if, as you look for your room,",0
364,"Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).",1
370,"Anyone looking for something a little bit special should look elsewhere,",1
377,"Is this the Hilton?",0
380,"Breakfast is delicious and plentiful.",0
381,"I believe the hotel is best for business clientle.",0
382,"We, a Scottish couple, decided to visit Berlin for four days and after reading positive reviews regarding the location of the Hilton,",0
383,"we decided to opt for that.",0
384,"On our arrival, we discovered that the hotel had overbooked",0
385,"and that there was to be no room there for our first night.",0
386,"We were a bit annoyed because the location of the hotel had been our primary reason for booking.",0
387,"We were asked to have one night in the Intercontinental and come back to the Hilton for the remainder of our stay.",0
388,"The Intercontinental was fine",0
389,"and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us.",0
390,"We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience.",0
391,"The staff and in particular, Doreen the acting front desk manager were all superb",0
392,"and truly went out of their way to make our stay more special.",0
393,"Breakfast choice was great,",0
394,"only slight criticism was the room where you have breakfast,",0
395,"sort of reminded me of a works canteen but that aside,",0
396,"choices were good and plenty of food available.",0
397,"Overall, you could do a lot worse than to go to the Berlin Hilton as the location is absolutely spot on for the underground,",0
398,"shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance.",0
399,"All in all, we had a great time.",0
400,"We found it worn and noisy.",0
401,"Is a remodel in the future?",0
402,"Prices reflect what you get.",0
403,"You may be well advised to try another address...",1
404,"We stayed at the Hilton for two nights at the beginning of December.",0
405,"The hotel is well place in the city, with a U-Bahn station right outside the door;",0
406,"this makes everywhere very easily accessible.",0
407,"We were also right next to one of the Christmas markets, which was handy.",0
408,"The hotel itself is fine;",0
409,"it is a fairly typical four star hotel, without any features to really set it apart from the rest.",0
410,"The lobby is grand in it's size, and is quite impressive.",0
411,"We were given a smoking room,",0
412,"and the staff were happy to move us to a less smelly non-smoking room when we asked.",0
413,"Throughout the stay the hotel staff were all very helpful and polite, and of course all spoke excellent English - as usual compounding my misery at being uni-lingual!",0
414,"Our room was clean",0
415,"and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice.",0
416,"The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate!",0
417,"The swimming pool and gym were both excellent,",0
418,"although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna...",0
419,"Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service.",0
420,"The hotel restaurants looked nice,",0
421,"but we did not try them.",0
422,"Probably my main criticism with the hotel is it's size - the hotel is very big and somewhat impersonal.",0
423,"Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out.",0
424,"The last time we stayed in Berlin (June),",0
425,"we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.",0
426,"Stayed 3 nights in March.",0
427,"All amenities associated with a good business hotel at an above average level.",0
428,"Excellent fitness room, though I did not use the spa/pool.",0
429,"Great location, a short walk to shopping  many popular points of interest (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, museums, checkpoint charlie).",0
430,"U-bahn station directly in front of hotel for easy transport to attractions farther west.",0
431,"Note breakfast and 24-hours of Internet use were an extra 22 euro each.",0
432,"Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice.",0
433,"Be prepared that most Berlin hotels do NOT have air conditioning!",0
434,"The Savoy only has room suites on the 6th floor with air conditioning.",0
435,"We upgraded directly with the hotel.",0

445,"I booked the hotel online before our trip.",0
446,"++++",0
447,"Christmas in Berlin was a wonderful experience here.",0
448,"Little gifts everyday of our stay made it easier to be away from home during the holiday.",0
449,"A huge decorated Cristmas tree and poinsettias in the lobby was enhanced by the deep red walls and wallpaper and crystal chandeliers.",0
450,"Elegant 1920's furnishings made the lobby a comfortable place to relax after museum hopping with a drink and a book while watching the world bustle by outside the window.",0
451,"The German staff was attentive to our requests without exception.",0
452,"Complimentary bottles of water and chocolates daily was good",0
453,"and the mini poinsettia and tin of chocolates made us smile.",0
454,"We enjoyed the ease of proximity to museums and good restaurants.",0
455,"A cigar bar off the lobby worried us until we discovered it did not offend our non-smoking sensibilities.",0
456,"The bathroom here was spacious, but a disabled person (me) would have trouble with the very deep tall tub.",0
457,"Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.",1
458,"A croissant and coffee around the corner was convenient and good at half the price.",0
459,"There are abundant taxis here",0
460,"but the U-bahn is cheaper and gets you most everywhere.",0
461,"Had a great stay in Berlin in May.",0
462,"Everything about the hotel was good,",0
463,"while the location was great.",0
464,"Short walks to K-damm, Savignyplatz, and zoo.",0
465,"Enjoyed the hospitality and helpfulness of the Savoy Berlin staff.",0
466,"Rooms are very spacious",0
467,"but most bathrooms are in urgent need of remodelling (the existing ones are dating back to the 60s!).",1
468,"The staff is very friendly and efficient.",0
469,"The only real downside of this hotel is its bar: It is a cigar bar",0
470,"and there are always some people inside smoking cuban cigars which makes the air inside unbearable.",0
471,"Sometimes, the smoke is drifting through the lobby and makes the whole place very unpleasant.",0
472,"There is no non-smoking section in the bar and quite frankly, if you are not a smoker yourself,",0
473,"it is better to avoid the bar.",1
474,"They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so.",1
475,"Breakfast is great.",0
476,"I stayed Savoy for two nights.",0

478,"The front desk was always polite as well as effieicent.",0
479,"The room decor was a classy, and yet cosy.",0
480,"very good after a long walking day in Berlin.",0
481,"My single room has a huge bathroom and a balcony.",0
482,"Some previous reviewers complained about the smoke released from the Cigar bar.",0
483,"It was not too heavy in my room since I aksed for non-smoking one.",0
484,"Breakfest is average, It did have a good selection",0
485,"but a bit pricey 19euros since you can have a decent breakfest in any Kaffee in Berlin.",1
486,"I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.",1
487,"Overall, I will stay Hotel Savoy again for my next Berlin trip for its location and service.",0
488,"If you're a non-smoker, don't stay here!",1

501,"The bed was very uncomfortable  old",0
502,"The air conditioning was turned off, even though it was cold outside our room was as hot as a sauna.",0

507,"Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.",0
508,"I am a very frequent traveller,",0
509,"I would not rate the hotel experience we had as 5 star, something on par with a 3 or 4 star but certainly not 5 star.",0
510,"We stayed at this hotel because it was near to K'damn",0
511,"and this was our first trip to berlin.",0
512,"We had a standard room on the lower floors overlooking the central courtyard.",0
513,"Probably not the best view if you were staying in mid-winter but perfect in the heat of the summer.",0
514,"The room was spotlessly clean.",0

603,"Half of Palace Hotel has been renovated recently and consists of contemporary landings and bedrooms/suites.",0
604,"The other block (directly above the main entrance) is still trapped in the 1970's time warp that's been mentioned by previous contributors.",0
605,"Unfortunately I ended up in the latter half!",0
606,"Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.",1
607,"The service at the hotel was reasonable,",0
608,"though I did find the concierge to be particularly unhelpful.",0
609,"However one of the redeeming features of the Palace Hotel is its location.",0
610,"The hotel can be reached from Tegel Airport by catching the X9 or slower 109 bus and getting off at the last stop (Zoologischer S+U Bahn).",0
611,"Close to the hotel are the 100",0

618,"The health facilities in the hotel are good,",0
619,"though the swimming pool was a bit short for my liking.",0
620,"However the staff is helpful and provide you with towels, dressing gown and sandals (to avoid you slipping on the floor).",0
621,"The spa facilities are also nice but cost an extra ____7 per day.",0
622,"For those looking for things to do whilst in Berlin, I would highly recommend the walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks (Discover Berlin) and Sandemans New Berlin (Red Berlin Tour and the Free Tour).",1
623,"The Reichstag Dome, TV Tower at Alexanderplatz, and Pergamon Museum are all worth a visit.",0
624,"The Intercontinental in Berlin was highly disappointing to my fiance",0
625,"and I. I was excited when we first checked in because the lobby is very grand and fairly well appointed.",0
626,"The staff seemed nice enough and helpful.",0
627,"The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.",0

634,"We got up in the middle of the night to crank up the AC and open the window, but the temperature didn't change.",0
635,"Only when we called the front desk in the morning did they instruct us to remove the wood paneling below the sink in the bathroom (which revealed all of the pipes, etc.) and manually turn down the radiator (which was on 5 - the highest level!).",0
636,"I would not recommend staying here,",1
637,"it is not a good value at all,",0
638,"not is it a good experience.",0
639,"The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting.",1
640,"The bathroom was only partly cleaned, especially the toilet wasn't. Even after telling housekeeping about the problems,",0
641,"so you have to take itThis is no 5-star hotel.",0
642,"But with their location and being one of the hotels in Berlin offering a great number of rooms, they think they simply don't have to work that hard.",0
643,"Very disappointing experience there!",0
644,"At $114 for each of three summer weeknights, I was really satisfied with the Intercontinental.",0
645,"I booked about a month in advance on their website.",0
646,"As stated in other reviews, the location is on the (slightly tourist) bus line 200 and a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, and 10 minutes to the Zoo Garten Train station.",0
647,"Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm.",0
648,"This was a decent vantage point and was obviously a safe and quiet neighborhood.",0
649,"Fast food restaurants are opposite the Gedaechtnis Kirche if you are absolutely desperare for cheap fare late at night.",0
650,"The rooms themselves are very modern, but almost frustratingly so.",0
651,"The bathroom door has a hole for a handle,",0
652,"and the toilet door is opaque.",0
653,"So, no real sense of firm privacy is established.",0
654,"The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door.",0
655,"So it was kind of easy to accidentally spill some water on the floor (not to mention slip and break your neck).",0
656,"Still the design was cool and memorable.",0
657,"The breakast buffet was too expensive for our liking,",0
658,"however, our guide book had a listing of six special places for breakfast in Berlin.",0
659,"What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street.",0
660,"The pool was mid-seized but adequate and clean.",0
661,"The whirlpool was out of this world.",0

677,"you can go buy your own water and snacks.",1
678,"you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.",1
679,"The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.",1
680,"The uber-efficient cleaning staff will attempt multiple times to clean your room if you don't have the sign displayed.",0
681,"I may be too crititical,",0

683,"The rooms are kept clean , but since the hotel is quite old,",0
684,"it doesn't have a very clean look.",0

692,"From 8 o' clock on it was just a banging of doors and throwing things around in the hallway.",0
693,"Roomcleaning takes place in as loud a fashion as possible.",0
694,"And since the hotel needs renovation,",0
695,"it all seems to happen right next to you.",0
696,"Another thing is that the cleaning lady just walked into my room on the morning of my last day.",0

708,"The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.",1
709,"When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.",1
710,"Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!",1
711,"Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................",1

713,"Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking.",1
714,"If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks",1
715,"if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.",1
716,"Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!",1
717,"I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality",1
718,"This hotel is badly in need of a manager who knows what is going on in the place.",1
719,"Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).",1
720,"This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.",1
721,"you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front.",1
722,"I do wish that the staff were more accomodating.",1
723,"If you prefer an outside room ask for one on an upper floor facing towards Berlin Catherdral only some 100 yards away.",1

725,"Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).",1

727,"I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.",1
728,"I really advice the hotel",1
729,"but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie.",1
730,"a smile or even some acknowledgment when handing in keys wouldn't go amiss).",1

736,"If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you.",1
737,"But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.",1
738,"The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.",1
739,"for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service.",1

751,"If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.",1
752,"The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it.",1
753,"Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars).",1

765,"Go somewhere with better service.",1
766,"It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.",1
767,"but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).",1
768,"but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).",1
