543,"Family-Friendly As a couple with a young child (toddler) in tow, we appreciated the ample and uncrowded public spaces more than the room itself.",X
544,"Between the points and a corporate rate, we were only supposed to pay about 800 Euros for a 5 night stay, which seemed very reasonable.",X
545,"When we arrived, we received the same treatment at the front desk as many previous reviewers...",X
546,"and they were generally disorganized and not very cordial (though not rude).",X
547,"The furniture was nice but shabby - scratched and dented.",X
548,"Being on the canal had its perks, but we could hear people walking by (talking, shouting and laughing) until the wee hours.",X
549,"We heard banging during the day.",X
550,"and while the breakfast was great, I wouldn't spend the extra 75 Euros a night to include it in the price of my room (seemingly the only differentiator between a regular room and executive).",X
551,"We did spend 38 Euros pp to take a 1.5 hour ride on their lovely canal boat, which would have been great if not for a family with a baby who showed up late with a stroller and displaced other passengers.",X
552,"We booked a three-night stay using Starpoints, arriving December 30," 2008.",X
553,"I am a Starwood Platinum,",X

556,"We could hear noises in the hallway, from the room above us, and from the heater.",X
557,"We stayed at the Pulitzer some time ago (August of 2007) so some memories are lost.",X
558,"We had a friend that stayed in a neighborhood closer to the red light district, and let me say...",X
559,"we spent a lot more time in our neighborhood.",X
560,"They have their own canal boat for tours",X
561,"but that is the norm for Amsterdam apparently (when our friend came over he said his room was ""pretty much the size of our bathroom...no, seriously!""",X

564,"My problems began when i arrived early for check in- 10am.",X
565,"As you can imagine i refused- not a good way to start your holiday.",X
566,"Views looked out to another building almost immediatly opposite",X
567,"and the lack of light was depressing (no ceiling light).",X
568,"To all their fairness they refunded back 1/3 of my fee, that still leaves 200 euros for the night which is still a ludicrous price for that hotel- My advise?",X
569,"I just read some of the bad reviews for the Pulitzer",X
570,"and I couoldn't agree more.",X
571,"Last year the hotel was still getting raves",X
572,"and it's about time that the reviews reflect how bad the place really is.",X

576,"I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon.",X
577,"As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties",X
578,"and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality.",X
579,"On the plus side, the location was great.",X
580,"It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon.",X
581,"It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race.",X
582,"I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great.",X
583,"They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son",X
584,"and he eats quite a bit.",X
585,"On the negative side, was the fact they did not change towels on one day",X
586,"and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay.",X
587,"Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour.",X
588,"I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse.",X
589,"This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers",X

591,"Overall the stay was just above neutral.",X
592,"I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times.",X

596,"Yes, they call it renovated.",X
597,"The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms.",X
598,"Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess.",X
599,"Still, the location is the best",X
600,"and the lobby is very pritty and impressive.",X
601,"But the rest of the hotel, forget about it.",X
602,"Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional.",X
603,"My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February.",X
604,"The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel.",X
605,"Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel.",X
606,"The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase,",X

609,"I concur with previous reviews;",X

624,"Service is so so.",X
625,"I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me!",X

629,"In reality, rooms look different!",X
630,"(and much worse!!)",X
631,"The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location.",X
632,"But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.",X
633,"The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room.",X
634,"I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable.",X
635,"I was staying here with my Starwood Points,",X
636,"so the room and breakfast were included in the award,",X
637,"but my points are valuable",X
638,"and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.",X
639,"A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,",X
640,"that same awful smell would drift by.",X
641,"We had a small trip to Berlin this spring and choosed this hotel because it is easy to reach and in the heart of berlin.",X
642,"Breakfast is one of the best I ever had,",X
643,"but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room.",X
644,"As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.",X
645,"The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it.",X
646,"Overall the hotel is quite ok,",X
647,"but I had better ones.",X
648,"Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal.",X
649,"I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.",X
650,"The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights.",X
651,"Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.",X
652,"The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.",X
653,"Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster.",X
654,"Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style.",X
655,"The room did show some signs of wear (nothing major though)",X
656,"but a refurbishment programme is in progress (we had a note apologising for any noise heard though we did not hear any).",X
657,"The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference.",X
658,"The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas.",X
659,"Everything worked well though",X
660,"and there was a good selection of bathroom products.",X
661,"Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite.",X

667,"and I the head of the tap came off.",X
668,"The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it.",X
669,"This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair.",X
670,"The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while.",X
671,"The sheets were not changed for three days",X
672,"and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it.",X
673,"However, the worst thing was the level of service (or rather the complete lack of it).",X
674,"We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed.",X
675,"I asked for the sheets to be changed three times",X
676,"and I was told they would be,",X
677,"but it never happened.",X
678,"Reception staff were plain rude",X
679,"and even the manager told me (I still can't believe I heard this) that they had given us a smoking room,",X
680,"even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish",X
681,"and most Spanish people smoke!",X
682,"We tried the pool to relax ouserselves",X
683,"but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area).",X
684,"The following day we were lucky with the towels, but found the poolside furniture dirty,",X
685,"We were never given any apologies or signs of regret for the shortcomings we had to deal with.",X
686,"A frustrating and depressing experience.",X
687,"I had to pinch myself to believe it was actually happening.",X
688,"I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005.",X
689,"I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements.",X
690,"The room was great with a modern updated decor.",X
691,"Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly.",X
692,"This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...",X
693,"Let's have a round of applause, please, for the Westin Grand, for taking discount bookings to a new low.",X
694,"I have long suspected that hotels reserve the smallest room, the one with the worst view, or the one by the elevator, for guests who pay a discounted rate ...",X
695,"but never before have I been offered a dirty, smelly room and then upcharged for a ""renovated"" (i.e. clean) room.",X
696,"you come to the end of a regular-looking hotel corridor, pass through a lounge, and into a narrow, dark and musty corridor with doorways just about your height and barely wide enough to fit your carry-on luggage ... well,",X
697,"you have been given a discount special!",X
698,"Turn around immediately and return to the front desk, where you will be charged an extra 30 Euros per night for a ""renovated"" room that, upon inspection, hasn't been renovated anytime in recent memory, but is at least cleaner and does not smell.",X
699,"Our first room was very small, the upholstery and lampshades(!) were stained, the furniture desperately needed to be refinished,",X
700,"and it had a very strong, musty odour (mould perhaps?) At the front desk we were told that because they were fully booked, they could only offer us another room in the same grade, or a ""renovated"" room for an extra 30 Euros per night.",X
701,"(Fully booked?",X
702,"But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?",X
703,"I'm not sure that I follow that logic, but whatever.) After our overseas flight we really didn't feel like arguing, so we just paid the extra - no way to say now if the other room in the same grade would have been acceptable.",X
704,"The second room, pictured here, was much better.",X
705,"It was larger, cleaner and updated (though the washroom was clearly not renovated, as I've noted in my pictures).",X
706,"I would have been perfectly happy if we had been offered this to begin with, and would have given the hotel a higher rating,",X
707,"but I consider our treatment unacceptable.",X
708,"Having said that, I still ranked this hotel a 2 rather than a 1 because the breakfast buffet was fantastic, and the location was very convenient for sightseeing.",X
709,"The room service was also quite good, and the staff friendly and (for the most part) helpful.",X
710,"I haven't stayed at too many nicer hotels.",X
711,"Nor would I generally spend over 300 Euros for a hotel (thankfully my Mom was paying for this stay).",X
712,"At the risk of sounding like a line from ""Cabaret,"" everything about this hotel is beautiful.",X
713,"The lobby is beautiful.",X
714,"The restaurants are beautiful.",X
715,"The rooms are beautiful.",X
716,"The pool and gym are are really beautiful.",X
717,"Even the breakfast is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach).",X
718,"We ate at both restaurants.",X
719,"The Trader Vic's puts our Trader Vic's here in Emeryville to shame, both with respect to decor and food quality.",X
720,"The German restaurant, Mark Brandenburg, simply had the best German food I've ever had (and I've been to Germany about 8-9 times).",X
721,"One needs to swipe ones room cards in order to access the floor rooms.",X
722,"The pool/gym area is open 24 hours/day.",X
723,"As a Gold HHonors member, we received an upgraded room, which was very quiet, comfortable, and large, but had no view (windows open to an inner courtyard).",X
724,"My complaints about the hotel: (1) Charging 22 Euros/day for lousy (off/on) internet service is a bit outrageous given the very high room charges, (2) Temperature difficult to adjust in the room (no thermostat),",X
725,"and we couldn't get it quite cool enough for comfort, (3) Rather thin towels for a luxury hotel, (4) Needless step to the beds; great for tripping on (especially for an older person such as my mother).",X
726,"So a very nice hotel, albeit not a great value.",X
727,"I would go here if money were of no object (and not otherwise).",X
728,"We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006.",X
729,"We are Diamond HHonor memebers,",X

738,"we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time.",X
739,"They also have a nice pool and spa",X
740,"but the children at all hours in the pool will drive you to the nudist spa area, which is pretty nice and child free.",X
741,"There are several good restaurants near by.",X
742,"We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture.",X
743,"The Potsdammer Platz is very times square with it's glass and steel highrises and heavy traffic.",X
744,"The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.",X
745,"The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.",X
746,"The lounge had a great breakfast and offered drinks through the day including wine, etc. at evenings with appetizers.",X
747,"Room _£_ Room was OK,",X

754,"the concierge that we went to see about finding a laundry mat was a bit of pain in the rear,",X
755,"he sent us to the right suburb but the wrong street,",X

757,"Overall _£_ This is a typical businessman_£_s / conference hotel.",X
758,"its location was it_£_s main attraction to us.",X
759,"Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday.",X
760,"We we allocated room 5088 which looked over an internal courtyard so very quiet but no view.",X
761,"Most importantly the room appeared clean and well maintained.",X
762,"The size of the room was adequate",X
763,"but the luxurious touches I would have expected from a hotel of this standard were in my opinion poor.",X
764,"There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel).",X
